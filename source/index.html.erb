      Everyday millions of women and children are forced to flee their homes and leave their communities behind. As people of faith it is essential to love and welcome these people in need.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our busy lives it is so easy to forget these people or feel overwhelmed at the immensity of the task, but together we can make a difference.

      We are raising awareness about the crisis and rallying Americans to action but we canâ€™t do it on our own. Using your voice to spread this message can play a major role in setting up humane, secure, and sustainable course of action to assist refugee families.
